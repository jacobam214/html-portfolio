<h1>The Best Movies According to Jacob</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>
<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>Ex Machina makes me want to make sweet cyberlove to a robo-baddie who lowkey hates my ass.</p>

<h3>Spongebob Movie</h3>
<p>
    I mean what can I say? <br/>
    Epic, raw, unfiltered, provocative...
</p>

<h3>Fantastic Mr. Fox</h3>
<p>So pretty much the fox has alot of swag but lowkey he be making his family stressed. <br/>
They were wrong for snatching his tail on some hater shit.
